# 👋 Hi, I'm Shubham Singh

I'm a Software Development Engineer at Amazon, where I design and build full-stack systems that simplify complex workflows and drive real business impact.


## 🚀 What I Do

- 🛠 **Backend Engineering**: Craft scalable services in **Go**, **Java**, and **Python** using modern infrastructure—**Kubernetes**, **Docker**, **AWS**, and **CI/CD pipelines**.
- 🌐 **Frontend Development**: Build sleek, responsive UIs with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**.
- 🔁 **Data Pipelines**: Develop high-throughput **PySpark** ETL pipelines processing millions of records monthly.
- ⚙️ **Automation & DevOps**: Automate workflows, streamline deployments, and reduce operational toil with a strong focus on maintainability and reliability.


## 📸 Outside Tech

When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me:
- 🏋️ Lifting at the gym
- 📷 Shooting street and travel photos on my **Fujifilm X100VI**
- 📖 Diving into a good book on architecture, design, or philosophy
